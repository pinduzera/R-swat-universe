\usage{
download_sas_binaries(
  libpath = .libPaths(),
  pkg_url = NULL,
  vb_version = "vb24110"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{libpath}{Character vector of library paths. The first element is used as the installation root. Defaults to `.libPaths()`.}

\item{pkg_url}{Optional explicit URL to a release tar.gz. If `NULL`, a URL is constructed from the installed swat package version.}

\item{vb_version}{Character scalar for the Viya build/version suffix embedded in the archive name (default: `"vb24110"`).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the destination path of the extracted `libs` directory.
}
\description{
Downloads and extracts platform-specific SWAT (SAS Scripting Wrapper for Analytics Transfer)
binary libraries into a swat/ subdirectory of the first library path returned by `.libPaths()`.
}
\note{
If `pkg_url` is not `NULL`, the current code does not set `url` (will error). You may want to add `url <- pkg_url` in the `else` branch.
